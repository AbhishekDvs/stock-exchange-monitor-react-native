<h1 align="center"> Welcome to the stock exchange monitor Wiki! </h1>

## Here, I will be presenting a small demo of how this app functions.
## It currently uses the stock API from RAPID API.

In the home screen, we have two options currently, either we can choose to monitor all the stocks simultaneously and search for an individual one by its stock identifier _(For example, NIFTY 50's identifier would be NIFTY 50)_

### This is how the home screen would look.

</p>

If we click on the option to monitor all the stocks, we are presented with an empty screen where we can either search by Index identifier (optional) or we can simply click on the search, which by default brings up all, since there is no condition as to what to search for.

## Alternatively: We have the option to search by a particular NSE Index, which brings up a picker with a wide range of indices.

We can pick one and get the result for all the indices in that **particular group**.

The below feature is available for both the screens.

We can also expand on any one particular stock that we're interested in, by just tapping on any of the stocks that you're interested on, and it'll show all the rest of the details regarding that stock.
